# scala-logging [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/typesafehub/scala-logging.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/typesafehub/scala-logging)

Scala Logging is a **convenient** and **performant** logging library wrapping [SLF4J](http://www.slf4j.org).

It's convenient, because you can simply call log methods, *without* checking whether the respective log level is enabled:

```scala
logger.debug(s"Some $expensive message!")
```

It's performant, because thanks to Scala macros the *check-enabled-idiom* is applied and the following code is generated:

```scala
if (logger.isDebugEnabled) logger.debug(s"Some $expensive message!")
```

## Prerequisites ##

* Java 6 or higher
* Scala 2.11 or 2.12
* Logging backend compatible with SLF4J

A compatible logging backend is [Logback](http://logback.qos.ch), add it to your sbt build definition:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "ch.qos.logback" % "logback-classic" % "1.1.7"
```

If you are looking for a version compatible with Scala 2.10, check out Scala Logging 2.x.

## Getting Scala Logging ##

Scala Logging is published to Sonatype OSS and Maven Central:

- Group id / organization: *com.typesafe.scala-logging*
- Artifact id / name: *scala-logging*
- Latest version is 3.5.0

Usage with SBT, adding a dependency to the latest version of Scala Logging to your sbt build definition file:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "com.typesafe.scala-logging" %% "scala-logging" % "3.5.0"
```

## Using Scala Logging ##

The `Logger` class from the `com.typesafe.scalalogging` package wraps an underlying SLF4J logger.
In order to create a `Logger`, you pass a name to the `apply` factory method defined in the `Logger` companion object:

```scala
val logger = Logger("name")
```

Or, you pass in a SLF4J logger instance:

```scala
val logger = Logger(LoggerFactory.getLogger("name"))
```

Or, you pass in a class:

```scala
val logger = Logger(classOf[MyClass])
```

Or, using the runtime class wrapped by the implicit class tag parameter:

```scala
val logger = Logger[MyClass]
```

The `LazyLogging` and `StrictLogging` traits from the `com.typesafe.scalalogging` package define the `logger` member as
a lazy or strict value respectively. In both cases the underlying SLF4J logger is named according to the class into which
these traits are mixed:

```scala
class MyClass extends LazyLogging {
  logger.debug("This is very convenient ;-)")
}
```

The `ImplicitLazyLogging` and `ImplicitStrictLogging` traits from the `com.typesafe.scalalogging` package define the `logger` member as
an implicit lazy or strict value respectively. You can use it with `com.typesafe.scalalogging.fluent.FluentLogging` implicit class to
inject logging into the computation.

```scala
class MyClass extends ImplicitLazyLogging {
  def complexComputation =
    (list: List[Any])
      .map(f1)
      .info("so far we have " + _)
      .collect(f2)
      .info("and now we have " + _)
      
  def simpleComputation =
    f3.debug(_ + " is logged directly from the statement, value passes through")
    
  val asExpected = simpleComputation
}
```

### What's new?

##### 3.5.0
 - More Logger factory methods, bugfixes and upgrades, published for Scala 2.12.0-M5, 2.12.0-RC1, 2.12.0-RC2 and 2.12.0.

##### 3.4.0
 - Fixes #38 - Logger.info() cannot be used with primitive types.

##### 3.3.0
 - Fixes #42 - Request: Add Logger(class). README changes.

##### 3.2.0
 - SLF4J loggers and our Logger now survive serialization. By survive serialization, we mean that the
   deserialized logger instances are fully functional.

## Line numbers in log message?

Using the [sourcecode](https://github.com/lihaoyi/sourcecode#logging) library, it's possible to add line number
information (especially useful for debugging):

```scala
def foo(arg: String)(implicit line: sourcecode.Line, file: sourcecode.File) = {
  ... do something with arg ...
  ... do something with file.value ...
}

foo("hello") // the implicit sourcecode.File is filled in automatically
```
